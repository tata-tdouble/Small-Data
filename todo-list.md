You are welcome to our To-Do List.

We are happy you interested in this project. 

Below is a list of the most pressing tasks in order of priority that must be complete for this project to move forward. 

# 1. Clone and set up the django-hackathon-starter repository on your computer.

Instructions can be found here: https://github.com/DrkSephy/django-hackathon-starter.git

# 2. Add your API credentials.

To add your API credentials to the program follow the instructions under the Chapter called "Obtaining API Keys" on the django-hackathon-starter page on github.

# 3. Change the name of the Website to Small Data (The Logo will be changed later).

Please if you know any graphic designer who might be willing to help us design a logo, please invite him/her to join our group on Whatsapp or our server on Discord.

# 4. Add Function.

# 5. Push edited code to the devlopment branch of our repo.
