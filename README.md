# SMALL DATA : Big Data for personal use

<b>What is Small Data ?</b>

Small data is an open source data mining web platform built with Python-Django. 

Small Data evolves around a combination of structured, semistructured and unstructured data submitted by individuals that can be mined for information using Big Data techniques. 

This data can be submitted to the platform using the following ways:

1) Upload a json file.
2) Grant the platform access to your data by signing in with a Google account or Facebook account or both.
3) Installing our browser extension on your browser.

Our server will process the data and provide an analysis that shines light on the individuals lifestyle and habits.

<b>How far has this project been developed?</b>
